Last thing I was doing:
- payouts on a winner nobody bet for causes a divide by zero crash!
- add lock timeout for bets

If I have X many options to bet on with unknown odds of winning, what maths is used at payout time to calculate how much the winners get relative to their stake such that they always get more than their stake back, and that the "house" doesn't have to top up the pool to meet the amount (and in fact can skim off it too)?
