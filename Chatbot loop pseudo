Last thing I was doing:
- fixed ping/ping. 
- Now suss out how the listening functions will work
- Then make the User listener make the list of active users

Chatbot loop pseudo

=============================== main:
- initialisations and includes
- connect to socket/twitch
- is bot already present? disconnect if so.
- any api calls need making?
- activate various features depending on settings
- so long as everything successful:

while running{
	- read incoming from socket.

	- does incoming need reacting to by bot infrastructure?
	--ie. ping/pong, twitch sending RECONNECT commands

	for f in listening_functions{

		- any function do logic reactions to these messages
		--should these functions ever break this loop?
		--can they from within the function

	}
	
}

=============================== user class
- array of users
- info like: username, id, inroom, lastmessage, opstatus, currencyamt

=============================== socket class:
- function openSocket // opens connection
- function closeSocket // closes
- function sendToSocket // sends a line to socket, utilised by the below *throttled based on twitch limits *keep arr of most recently sent
- function sendMessage // sends message to channel 
- function sendWhisper // sends whisper to user
- function setUserStatus // sets user status *throttled based on twitch limits

=============================== read class:
- function getUserList // returns entire REMEMBERED userlist, not necessarily live
- function getUserDetails // returns details of single given username
- function getUser // parses user from line
- function getMessage // parses message from line

=============================== spam controls:
- kick for X messages in Y time
- kick for X use of set word in Y time
- Insta or strike system

=============================== polls:
- polls by mods vote on 1 of X options
- 1 vote per user 

=============================== currency:
/* Notes:
- Currency name in settings (ie, cakes or biscuits or something)
- Earned by:
	X per Z time spent in chat (last-message timer for AFK people?)
	rewarded by mods
	betting
	lottery
- Spent by:
	Discards (ie, username shoved X currencyname into players's face)
	Pay X amount for custom join message from the bot
- Bets: 
	a true/false to be confirmed by chat mod (ie, player achieves this run)
	a time until-true to be triggered by chat (ie, player dies withint X, Y, or Z minutes)
- Lottery:
	pool of credits built from peoples contributions (allow multiple entries?)
	randomly chosen by system
- Leaderboards:
	List top X currency-havers
	List fastest X currency-earners
	List fastest X currency-losers
- Trivia:
	X currency for first correct answer
	If not instant end, rewards for other correct answerers
